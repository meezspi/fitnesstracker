In this exercise, I managed to create a search bar in fitness.html. I added get request, which I transferred to the controller. I then tried to use the model to create the quote. I was unable to get the model to pass the full usernames array, although I had tried similar methods before. Hopefully you can follow my thinking. Thanks for a good semester.
